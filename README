unit tests
==========

The sources contains some unit tests (written using python unittest
module) in the 'tests' directory.

To run the tests we can either run them individually as python script,
either use `python nose`_.  If using nose then we just need to go into
the tests directory and invoke nosetest from there (make sure that
pyth module is in PYTHONPATH).
